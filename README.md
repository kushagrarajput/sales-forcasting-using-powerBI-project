### Project Overview
This project leverages advanced data analysis techniques, with a particular focus on time series analysis, to extract actionable insights from sales data. The primary objectives are to accurately forecast sales, identify trends and patterns, and create interactive dashboards for informed decision-making.

### Methodology
* **Data Acquisition and Preparation:**
  * Gather relevant sales data from various sources.
  * Cleanse and preprocess data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
  * Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  * Conduct in-depth EDA to understand data characteristics.
  * Identify patterns, trends, and seasonality in sales data.
  * Visualize data to gain initial insights.
* **Time Series Analysis:**
  * Decompose time series data into trend, seasonality, and residual components.
* **Sales Forecasting:**
  * Generate accurate sales forecasts for various time horizons.
  * Create confidence intervals for forecast accuracy.
* **Dashboard Development:**
  * Design and develop interactive dashboards using Power BI or other visualization tools.
  * Incorporate key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizations.
  * Enable drill-down and filtering capabilities for exploration.
